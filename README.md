## Description
My task was to create an interactive weather dashboard using Javascript and starter HTML code. It should provide users with the weather data of any city when searched. The requirements were: 

* Create a weather dashboard with form inputs.
  * When a user searches for a city they are presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
  * When a user views the current weather conditions for that city they are presented with:
    * The city name
    * The date
    * An icon representation of weather conditions
    * The temperature
    * The humidity
    * The wind speed
  * When a user view future weather conditions for that city they are presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the same statistics as above 
  * When a user click on a city in the search history they are again presented with current and future conditions for that city
